-- Reddit Content Scout — no-repeat ledger (REQUIREMENTS §5.1).
-- Run once in the NEW Supabase project: Dashboard → SQL Editor → paste → Run.

-- Reset deliberately with:  truncate table reddit_seen;
-- (Never dropped by the app — the ledger is the permanent memory.)

create table if not exists reddit_seen (
  post_id      text primary key,                     -- Reddit base36 id (e.g. "1abcde"), no "t3_" prefix
  status       text not null check (status in ('used', 'rejected')),

  title        text not null,
  decided_at   timestamptz not null default now(),
  -- Candidate FEATURES at decide time (nullable — the mark-used hook has no candidate context).
  -- status = the label, these = the features: every decision is a training row for the phase-2 ranker.
  body         text,                                 -- selftext (≤40k chars, Reddit's own cap)
  score        integer,
  num_comments integer,
  created_utc  bigint,
  category     text,                                 -- scout category A-D from config at decide time

-- The app talks to this table server-side only (API routes) with the project's SECRET key
-- (sb_secret_… on new projects; legacy service_role JWT also works), which bypasses RLS.
-- Enable RLS with no policies so the public/publishable key can't touch the ledger at all.
